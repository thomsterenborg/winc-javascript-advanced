# JavaScript Advanced - Final Project: Cake searcher

This was the final project for the JavaScript Advanced module in the Winc Academy Front-end Developer course. All I got was the the JSON-file with cake recipes and a index.js with tests that I needed to run after I was done.

Some of the requirements were:
 * Searches have to be case insensitive
 * Partial search terms needed to be possible, for example "simpl" needed to return both simple and simplified. 
 * When an author was searched by their fullname, only that author could be in the results. If an author was searched by only the firstname, all authors with that firstname could be in the results.
 * Found recipes had to be printed in a nice wat in the console.
